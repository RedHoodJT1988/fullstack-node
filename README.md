# Fullstack Node
This is the code from my time spent with Node. Just trying to create various projects
that showcase the capabilities of the Node.

## Projects
Here is the list of the projects that will be created in this repo. Will update this
after all the projects have been completed. 

1. Basic API: This is the code for a very basic API with three routes that give back
different data responses depending on the endpoint hit. This covers both creating a
basic app with just the core features of Node as well as implementing Express.

2. Real-Time Chat: This is an application showing the power of Node to create a 
real-time chat application. This uses Express to help with the http calls and 
data responses.

3. Async API: This application shows the power of using Node to create asynchronous
APIs. This covers using Callbacks, Promises as well as the Async/Await method. 
Also dives into using Emitters and Streams.

4. A Complete Server: This will showcase how to create a complete server for an
e-commerce website. In this application we will cover the use of persistence with a
database, authentication for handling user accounts, deploying the server to Heroku.

5. Command Line Interface(CLI): This will be a very basic CLI tool that showcases the
use of Node to create CLI tools for whatever you may need.

6. Testing: This project was helpful in learning more about the testing libraries 
that can be used to verify your Node apps are working correctly.
